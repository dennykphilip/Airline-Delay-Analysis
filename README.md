This repository contains the Power BI project and dataset for analyzing delays experienced by major U.S. airlines. The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights into the types of delays affecting flights, identify the top airlines with the most delays, and explore the reasons behind these delays.

Objectives:
  1. Analyze different types of delays (e.g., due to security, weather, NAS, diverted flights, cancellations) to understand their impact on flight schedules.
  2. Identify the top 5 airlines with the highest number of delays, considering all types of delays combined.
  3. Provide visual insights using Power BI to help stakeholders quickly interpret the data.
